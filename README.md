# FieldsOfMistria.App

Heavily inspired by [stardew.app](https://stardew.app) this is a web application that allows you to manage your farm in [Fields of Mistria](https://fieldsofmistria.com/).

- [Application](./app/)
  - The source code for the main application is written in TypeScript and React.
- [Data Reader](./data-reader/)
  - The data reader is responsible for parsing and extracting information from the [Fields of Mistria wiki](https://fieldsofmistria.wiki.gg/). It provides a structured way to access game data, such as items, locations, and NPCs.
